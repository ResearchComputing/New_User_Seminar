#  Alpine New User Seminar (an RC Primer)

New to CU Research Computing, but don't know where to start? This RC Primer training is designed to give you an overview of Research Computing resources, procedures and best practices. You will learn how to log in, request allocations, store and transfer data, load software, run a job, and ask for help.

In order to follow along with the hands-on component of this session, youâ€™ll want to have a research computing account. If you need assistance with this, you can attend the RC Quick Byte - Getting a Research Computing Account on April 2. Additionally, we will hold CRDDS Office Hours immediately following this session for any follow-up questions.
